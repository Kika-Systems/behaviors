# Chapter 2: Using Autopilot


## Creating your first behavior
A behavior is a JavaScript file which executes a series of actions that collect some information (metadata) about a webpage. When creating a behavior, you should first take a look at the Pre-Made Behaviors on the Status Page <!-- add links to this once the Status Page is done -->. This will give you a basic idea of what kind of behaviors already have been created.

Once you have an idea of what you want your behavior to do, clone the webrecorder repository so that you can work locally on your computer.

1. `mkdir webrecorder` (or skip these two steps and use an already existing directory)
2. `cd webrecorder`
3. `git clone https://github.com/webrecorder/behaviors.git`



Next, make a file in the appropriate directory (i.e. if the behavior is specific to Facebook, put the file under the Facebook directory).

For example:
```
touch webrecorder/facebook/myBehavior/
```
